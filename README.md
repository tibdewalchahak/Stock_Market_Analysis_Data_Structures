# 📈 Stock Market Analysis using Structures (Data Structure) in C

This is a console-based C program that analyzes stock market data over 30 trading days for 10 different companies. It was developed as part of the Data Structures and Program Design course to strengthen the understanding of core DSA concepts like arrays, structures, sorting algorithms, and file handling through a real-world use case.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Structures and Arrays
- File I/O operations
- Sorting (Insertion, Selection)
- Percentage calculations
- Modular function design
- Menu-driven program

---

## 🗃️ Project Structure
- `stocks_data.txt` – Input file containing historical stock data (open, high, low, close, volume)
- Main source code includes functions for:
  - 📊 Percent change calculations
  - 📉 Profit/Loss analysis
  - 🧮 Sorting by volume and price
  - 🥇 Finding highest/lowest performers
  - 📈 Weighted averages & overall performance

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Make sure `stocks_data.txt` is in the same directory.
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc stock_analysis.c -o stock_analysis
   ```
4. Run it
   ```bash
   ./stock_analysis
   ```
## 📚 Academic Context
